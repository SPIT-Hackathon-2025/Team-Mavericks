Let's kick things off by discussing the project timelines. We need to make sure we’re all aligned for the upcoming milestones. Tejahree, could you share your thoughts on the initial phase of the project?\" ------------------------------ *Tejahree P:* \"Sure, Jayesh. For the first phase, we should focus on gathering data and defining the requirements clearly. We need to set up the necessary tools and infrastructure by the end of this week, and start initial testing by next Monday.\" ------------------------------ *Savio M:* \"I agree with Tejahree. I think we should also ensure the project documentation is in place from the start. It’ll help us stay organized as we move forward. Once the requirements are set, we can start assigning tasks to the different teams.\" ------------------------------ *Jayesh Chaudhari:* \"Good point, Savio. We can start by drafting a project outline and get the documentation process going. How do you feel about coordinating with the teams for task assignments once we have a clearer picture, Tejahree?\" ------------------------------ *Tejahree P:* \"That works. After the tools are set up, we can assign the tasks. We’ll also need to schedule follow-up meetings to track progress and make sure everyone’s on track.\" ------------------------------ *Jayesh Chaudhari:* \"Sounds great. We also need to ensure that we have adequate testing phases planned in the timeline. I’d suggest a two-week window for the first round of testing after the initial setup.\" ------------------------------ *Savio M:* \"I’m on board with that. Having two weeks for testing will allow us to identify any issues early. We can also have a review session at the end of the testing phase to discuss results and next steps.\" ------------------------------ *Tejahree P:* \"Yes, absolutely. After the review, we can finalize the next phase based on the feedback from testing. If everything goes well, we can begin development in the second month.\" ------------------------------ *Jayesh Chaudhari:* \"Perfect! Let’s finalize the timeline and make sure everyone’s aware of their roles. I’ll send out a draft of the timeline by tomorrow, and we’ll tweak it during our next catch-up meeting.\" ------------------------------ *Savio M:* \"Sounds good. I’ll help with the timeline review and make sure all tasks are aligned. Let me know if you need anything from me.\" ------------------------------ *Tejahree P:* \"All good here too. Looking forward to seeing the draft timeline.\" ------------------------------ *Jayesh Chaudhari:* \"Thanks, Savio and Tejahree. I’ll send the draft timeline soon. Let’s meet again next week to review the progress. Have a great day!\" ------------------------------ *End of Transcript.* ------------------------------ Best regards, *Jayesh Chaudhari* Project Manager, XYZ Inc.",
